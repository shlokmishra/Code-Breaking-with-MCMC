# Code Breaking with MCMC

A project on using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to break ciphers and analyze encrypted text.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of MCMC algorithms in cracking ciphers and analyzing encrypted text. The project includes implementations of popular MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling, along with a suite of cipher-breaking functions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Theoretical Background

The theory behind MCMC algorithms is based on Bayesian statistics and can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$\pi(\theta|x) \propto L(x|\theta) \pi(\theta)$$

where $\pi(\theta|x)$ is the posterior distribution, $L(x|\theta)$ is the likelihood function and $\pi(\theta)$ is the prior distribution.

## Implementations

The project includes implementations of the following MCMC algorithms:

- Metropolis-Hastings
- Gibbs Sampling

Each algorithm has been tested on a variety of ciphers and encrypted text, and the results have been compared and analyzed.

## Conclusion

The results of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of MCMC algorithms in cracking ciphers and analyzing encrypted text. These algorithms have the potential to be used in real-world applications for code breaking and encryption analysis.
